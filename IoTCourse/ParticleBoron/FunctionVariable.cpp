// -----------------------------------------
// Function and Variable with Photoresistors
// -----------------------------------------
// In this example, we're going to register a Particle.variable() with the cloud so that we can read brightness levels from the photoresistor.
// We'll also register a Particle.function so that we can turn the LED on and off remotely.

// We're going to start by declaring which pins everything is plugged into.

int led = D7; // This is where your LED is plugged in. The other side goes to a resistor connected to GND.

int photoresistor = A0; // This is where your photoresistor is plugged in. The other side goes to the "power" pin (below).

int idk = A5; // This is the other end of your photoresistor. The other side is plugged into the "photoresistor" pin (above).
// The reason we have plugged one side into an analog pin instead of to "power" is because we want a very steady voltage to be sent to the photoresistor.
// That way, when we read the value from the other side of the photoresistor, we can accurately calculate a voltage drop.

int analogvalue; // Here we are declaring the integer variable analogvalue, which we will use later to store the value of the photoresistor.

// Finally, we will write out our ledToggle function, which is referenced by the Particle.function() called "led"

int ledToggle(String command) {

    if (command=="on") {
        digitalWrite(led,HIGH);
        return 1;
    }
    else if (command=="off") {
        digitalWrite(led,LOW);
        return 0;
    }
    else {
        return -1;
    }

}


// Next we go into the setup function.

void setup() {

    // First, declare all of our pins. This lets our device know which ones will be used for outputting voltage, and which ones will read incoming voltage.
    pinMode(led,OUTPUT); // Our LED pin is output (lighting up the LED)
    pinMode(photoresistor,INPUT);  // Our photoresistor pin is input (reading the photoresistor)
    pinMode(idk,OUTPUT); // The pin powering the photoresistor is output (sending out consistent power)

    // Next, write the power of the photoresistor to be the maximum possible, so that we can use this for power.
    digitalWrite(idk,HIGH);

    // We are going to declare a Particle.variable() here so that we can access the value of the photoresistor from the cloud.
    Particle.variable("analogvalue", &analogvalue, INT);
    // This is saying that when we ask the cloud for "analogvalue", this will reference the variable analogvalue in this app, which is an integer variable.

    // We are also going to declare a Particle.function so that we can turn the LED on and off from the cloud.
    Particle.function("led",ledToggle);
    // This is saying that when we ask the cloud for the function "led", it will employ the function ledToggle() from this app.

}


// Next is the loop function...

void loop() {

    // check to see what the value of the photoresistor is and store it in the int variable analogvalue
    analogvalue = analogRead(photoresistor);

}
